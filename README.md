Our Machine Learning project is to use Linear Regression/Ridge/Lasso to predict House Sale.

## First step
——————————————
Firstly we download the data from www.kaggle.com in which it provides lots of different kinds of dataset. 
Our dataset includes two parts: train.csv and test.csv. The training part is used for fitting the models. The testing part is the testing data which does not contain HousePrice part and we need to use the models to predict the house sale of this part.

## Second step
